Autoexec Script for Walking Around the Map
This script will make your character move forward, turn, and repeat the process to simulate walking around the map.

Important Note
This script is very basic and may not produce perfect walking patterns. More sophisticated pathing would require more complex scripting or external tools, which may not comply with the game's terms of service. Use this script responsibly and always ensure compliance with game rules to avoid penalties.


Using the Autoexec File!!!!
Save the autoexec.cfg File:

Save the above script as autoexec.cfg in the tf/cfg directory.
Launch Team Fortress 2:

Open Team Fortress 2.
The script should run automatically if named autoexec.cfg. If it doesn't, you can manually execute it by opening the console (~ or `` key) and typing exec autoexec.
Start Walking:

Press F4 to start the walking sequence.
Adjustments:

You can adjust the wait values to change the duration of each movement.
Modify the sequence to better fit the map or desired path.


Explanation:
Enable Console (con_enable 1): Ensures the console is enabled so you can use it.
Walk Sequence:
walk_1: Moves forward for a certain period (wait 200), then moves left for a certain period, and then calls turn_1.
turn_1: Changes the yaw speed (turning speed), turns left for a short period (wait 100), and then calls walk_2.
walk_2: Moves forward for a certain period, then moves right for a certain period, and then calls turn_2.
turn_2: Changes the yaw speed, turns right for a short period, and then calls walk_1 again, creating a loop.
Start and Stop Aliases:
+walkmap: Starts the walking sequence by calling walk_1.
-walkmap: Placeholder for stopping the walking sequence (can be expanded if needed).
Bind to Key: The bind "F4" "+walkmap" line binds the start of the walking sequence to the F4 key.
Echo Confirmation: The echo "Autoexec loaded!" line confirms that the autoexec file has been loaded.
