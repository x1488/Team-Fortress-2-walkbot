Autoexec Script for Walking Around the Map
This script will make your character move forward, turn, and repeat the process to simulate walking around the map.

Important Note
This script is very basic and may not produce perfect walking patterns. More sophisticated pathing would require more complex scripting or external tools, which may not comply with the game's terms of service. Use this script responsibly and always ensure compliance with game rules to avoid penalties.
